Purpose:

NVIDIA has been the attention of the market recently, especially with its significant growth that exceeds a lof of people expectations. The goal of this project is to arrive at NVIDIA's intrinsic value and make sure there is not overly optimistic or pessimistic expectations for NVIDIA.

Results:

The implied share price was caculated using two methods: $360.66 using the Exit Multiple Method and $244.21 using Terminal Growth Method. Even though NVIDIA is a public company, it is still growing like a startup. This is why I assume that NVIDIA has not reached its maturity yet, meaning more explosive growth to come.
The result also implied that NVIDIA has a "Strong Buy" rating, given that the current price is only at $135.34 (as of 11/27/2024) and expects to grow approximately twice its current valuation in the future.
